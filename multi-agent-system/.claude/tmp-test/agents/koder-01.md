Implementation plan (no code changes):
1. Locate any existing “koder” output artifacts, fixtures, or docs (e.g., README, test data directories) and note expected formats/fields.
2. Identify the smoke test entry points (test runner, scripts, or CI config) and confirm where a smoke test should live in this repo.
3. Define the minimal acceptance criteria for “koder output” (e.g., file exists, non-empty, required keys present).
4. Draft a test outline (inputs, invocation command, expected output checks, failure messages).
5. Verify how to run the smoke test locally and in CI (commands, environment variables, dependencies).Implementation plan (no code changes):
