# Decisions

- 2026-01-26 Track progress by phases (12 total). (owner: Nicita, rationale: roadmap is phase-based)
- 2026-01-26 Phase 2 owner is Nicita; target due date 2026-01-28. (owner: Nicita, rationale: short 2-day iteration)
- 2026-01-26 Mark phases 1,2,3,4,9 as implemented based on code + smoke tests. (owner: Nicita, rationale: re-audit verification)
- 2026-01-26 Mark phase 6 as implemented based on edge-case tests and stable predictive_plan schema. (owner: Nicita, rationale: verification complete)
- 2026-01-26 Mark phase 10 as implemented based on prompt tests (pending coder/tester signoff). (owner: Nicita, rationale: verification complete)
- 2026-01-26 Do not close phases without coder/tester signoff; reopen phases 6 and 10 as pending. (owner: Nicita, rationale: process correction)
- 2026-01-26 S10 tester signoff received; awaiting coder signoff. (owner: Nicita, rationale: process compliance)
- 2026-01-26 S10 coder signoff received; phase 10 closed. (owner: Nicita, rationale: tests passed and edge cases reviewed)
- 2026-01-26 S7 coder/tester signoff received; phase 7 closed. (owner: Nicita, rationale: tests passed for tool generation)
- 2026-01-26 S8 coder/tester signoff received; phase 8 closed. (owner: Nicita, rationale: tests passed for cross-project memory)
- 2026-01-26 S11 coder/tester signoff received; phase 11 closed. (owner: Nicita, rationale: tests passed for self-mod pipeline)
- 2026-01-26 S12 coder/tester signoff received; phase 12 closed. (owner: Nicita, rationale: tests passed for distributed execution MVP)
- 2026-01-27 S13 coder/tester signoff received; control plane enabled (3-call deliberation, 10k/day budget, 90-day retention). (owner: Nicita, rationale: requirements satisfied)
- 2026-01-27 S14 coder/tester signoff received; tooling layer enabled (ToolDefinition + Workspace + Terminal). (owner: Nicita, rationale: tests passed)
- 2026-01-27 Full audit sweep found parallel_reasoning router=None regression; fixed to return stable dict schema. (owner: Nicita, rationale: test failure resolved)
- 2026-01-27 Budget accounting counts every outbound LLM attempt, including fallbacks. (owner: Nicita, rationale: enforce 10k/day cap per request attempt)
- 2026-01-27 Runtime graph path must run deliberation pipeline before any LLM call. (owner: Nicita, rationale: control-plane consistency)
- 2026-01-27 Self-mod sandbox blocks secret files (.env*, key material, .aws/credentials, .ssh). (owner: Nicita, rationale: prevent secret modification via patches)
- 2026-01-27 SandboxWorkspace resolves relative paths against base root and preserves allowed roots across mode changes. (owner: Nicita, rationale: avoid path escape/regression)
- 2026-01-27 Cross-project scan skips symlinks and enforces root containment. (owner: Nicita, rationale: avoid indexing outside roots)
